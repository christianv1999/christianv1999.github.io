This is a project I was assigned to work on through Chegg Skills web development bootcamp. It involves replicating a sample portfolio from scratch using the methods we had learned so far. The portfolio consists of an About, Portfolio and Contact section, where I implemented the clicks to be clickable and direct to the appropriate section. From there it was adding the content onto the page and once that was done, I worked on the CSS to orientate the content properly as instructed. The images were assigned to us and we had to render it to the proper sizing, as wellas using the appropriate colors given to us.

This assignment was provided to me byChegg Skills and is the first of many projects from them I will be displayig in the future!
